# 🌀 Project Punarnava: The Rta-Resonance Protocol

### **Architect: Independent Research & Systems Design**
Integrating **Vedic Systems Theory** ($Rta$) with **Quantum Computational Frameworks** to recalibrate the global digital nervous system.

---

## 🏛️ Executive Summary
Project Punarnava is a protocol layer designed to transition social media algorithms from **Entropy-Based Engagement** to **Equilibrium-Based Resonance**. By utilizing real-time astronomical data and ancient mathematical constants, we provide a blueprint for a self-healing digital ecosystem.

## ⚙️ Core Architecture
- **Dharma-Logic Engine:** A ranking system that prioritizes $Sattvic$ (balanced) content over high-entropy noise.
- **NASA Data Integration:** Utilizing real-time Solar Wind and Planetary position APIs to calibrate user-feed frequency.
- **The Resonance Formula:**
  $$I_R = (Engagement \times 1.08) - (\Delta Entropy \times 0.5)$$

## 🚀 Active Repositories
- [the-algorithm (Forked)](https://github.com/joydeep-hue/the-algorithm): Injecting Rta-logic into the heavy-ranking pipeline.
- **Vedic-AI-Logic:** Decentralized storage of sacred mathematical constants.
